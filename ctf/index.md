# Who

Everyone may participate (onsite or offsite). If you want to be eligible for prizes, you need to have at least one member of the team onsite **and** you need to show up at the organizer's registration desk at the conference **before the end of the CTF** so we can change your team status to local.

# CTF Registration

Registration will open on Tue, Oct. 9 at [the ctf page](https://arcade.fluxfingers.net)! 

# What

The CTF event will be ''challenge based'', i.e. the CTF is separated
into small tasks that can be solved individually. The scoreboard will be
web accessible and no VPN is required. We are trying our best to give
all participants a delightful experience, the covered topics are
somewhere around crypto, web security, reverse engineering and binary exploitation. Have a look at the previous
CTFs on the [archive](https://ctf.fluxfingers.net).

We are looking forward to seeing you participate - locally or from
remote. Direct your questions to somebody at our booth or on
[IRC](irc://chat.freenode.net/fluxfingers) (**#fluxfingers** on **freenode**).

# Rules

*    Each challenge gives a dynamic amount of points based on the number of solves.
*    No DoS/automated scans/large amounts of traffic/deleting stuff on our servers.
*    If you find something that solves too easy it might be a bug. Please report it for possible bonus points.
*    Do not share flags or solutions with other teams. We will not tolerate flag sharing.
*    If you break the rules we will kick your butt and remove all your points. Promised.
